Priority Streamer Block

This block prioritizes the input stream that is connected to port 0 over the input stream that is connected to port 1.
When the input 0 stream contains samples with non-zero magnitudes, stream 0 is automatically connected to the output port.  
When the input 0 stream contains samples that are zero in magnitude, stream 1 is connected to the output port.

Example Usage: when monitoring a frequency with both analog and digital voice, you can connect the analog FM demodulated audio
to input port 1 and connect the decoded digital audio to port 0.  This allows you to hear analog audio by default, but 
automatically switch to digital audio when it is present on input port 0.

The block is avaiable in gnuradio companion.  Complied under gnuradio version 3.6.5.1.
